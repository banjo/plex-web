## Disclaimer

This project was created when I first started with programming. It does not work anymore since the Plex API has changed. I mostly leave it here for nostalgic reasons.

## :information_source:	 Info
This is my **final project** in the **[CS50](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science)** course. It includes most of the programming languages that are covered in the course; HTML, Python, Javascript and Jinja. Python is used as back-end with Flask, and Javascript is used to make the page dynamic. The page design hasn't been the main focus, but Bootstrap has been used to make it look as good as possible.

This project was based on **lack of playlists in Plex**. When you have a movie library, the built in selection are pretty much useless. Therefore, I created a simple web app that adds playlists based on scraping a choosen IMDb list (like [this](https://www.imdb.com/list/ls026173135/)). You can add any list you find, and the web is full of them. All movies that you have in your library that matches the movies in the list will be added to a playlist.

The other features of the web app are just neat implementations that enhances the management of playlists.
